# Random-Number-Generation
This code provides the list of differnt built in functions in python and matlab to generate the pseudo random numbers with uniform and normal/gaussian distributions. The Box Muller method is implemented to obtained two independent sets of normal distributions from the independent uniform distributions. This code is helpful to understand the noise term in the Langevin equations to numerical simulate the 
Maxwellian demon using the tunable flux qubit.
